      <section><title>POIFS for OLE 2 Documents</title>
        <p>
	  POIFS is the oldest and most stable part of the project.  It is our port of the OLE 2 Compound Document Format to
          pure Java.  It supports both read and write functionality.  All of our components ultimately rely on it by
          definition.  Please see <link href="./poifs/index.html">the POIFS project page</link> for more information.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HSSF and XSSF for Excel Documents</title>
        <p>
	  HSSF is our port of the Microsoft Excel 97(-2007) file format (BIFF8) to pure
          Java. XSSF is our port of the Microsoft Excel XML (2007+) file format (OOXML) to
          pure Java. SS is a package that provides common support for both formats with a common API.
	  They both support read and write capability. Please see
          <link href="./spreadsheet/index.html">the HSSF+XSSF project page</link> for more
          information.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HWPF and XWPF for Word Documents</title>
	<p>
	  HWPF is our port of the Microsoft Word 97 (-2003) file format to pure
	  Java.  It supports read, and limited write capabilities. It also provides
      simple text extraction support for the older Word 6 and Word 95 formats.
      Please see <link href="./document/index.html">the HWPF project page for more
	    information</link>.  This component remains in early stages of
	  development. It can already read and write simple files.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We are also working on the XWPF for the WordprocessingML (2007+) format from the 
	  OOXML specification. This provides read and write support for simpler
      files, along with text extraction capabilities.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HSLF and XSLF for PowerPoint Documents</title>
	<p>
	  HSLF is our port of the Microsoft PowerPoint 97(-2003) file format to pure
	  Java. It supports read and write capabilities. Please see <link
	    href="./slideshow/index.html">the HSLF project page for more
	    information</link>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We are also working on the XSLF for the PresentationML (2007+) format from the 
	  OOXML specification.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HPSF for OLE 2 Document Properties</title>
	<p>
	  HPSF is our port of the OLE 2 property set format to pure
	  Java. Property sets are mostly use to store a document's properties
	  (title, author, date of last modification etc.), but they can be used
	  for application-specific purposes as well.
	</p>
	<p>
	  HPSF supports both reading and writing of properties.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Please see <link href="./hpsf/index.html">the HPSF project
	    page</link> for more information.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HDGF for Visio Documents</title>
	<p>
	  HDGF is our port of the Microsoft Viso 97(-2003) file format to pure
	  Java. It currently only supports reading at a very low level, and
	  simple text extraction. Please see <link
	    href="./hdgf/index.html">the HDGF project page for more
	    information</link>.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HPBF for Publisher Documents</title>
	<p>
	  HPBF is our port of the Microsoft Publisher 98(-2007) file format to pure
	  Java. It currently only supports reading at a low level for around
	  half of the file parts, and simple text extraction.  Please see <link
	    href="./hpbf/index.html">the HPBF project page for more
	    information</link>.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HMEF for TNEF (winmail.dat) Outlook Attachments</title>
	<p>
     HMEF is our port of the Microsoft TNEF (Transport Neutral Encoding
     Format) file format to pure Java. TNEF is sometimes used by Outlook
     for encoding the message, and will typically come through as
     winmail.dat. HMEF currently only supports reading at a low level, but
     we hope to add text and attachment extraction. Please see <link
	    href="./hmef/index.html">the HMEF project page for more
	    information</link>.
	</p>
      </section>
      <section><title>HSMF for Outlook Messages</title>
	<p>
	  HSMF is our port of the Microsoft Outlook message file format to pure
	  Java. It currently only some of the textual content of MSG files, and
      some attachments. Further support and documentation is coming in slowly.
	  For now, users are advised to consult the unit tests for example use.
	  Please see <link href="./hsmf/index.html">the HSMF project page for more
	    information</link>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Microsoft has recently added the Outlook file format to its OSP. More information
	  is now available making implementing this API an easier task.

    <section><title>What is it?</title>
      <p>The Apache POI project is the master project for developing pure
        Java ports of file formats based on Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound
        Document Format.  OLE 2 Compound Document Format is used by
        Microsoft Office Documents, as well as by programs using MFC
        property sets to serialize their document objects.
      </p>
      <p>Apache POI is also the master project for developing pure
        Java ports of file formats based on Office Open XML (ooxml.) 
        OOXML is part of an ECMA / ISO standardisation effort. This
        documentation is quite large, but you can normally find the bit you
        need without too much effort!
        <link href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm">ECMA-376 standard is here</link>,
        and is also under the 
        <link href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecifications/default">Microsoft OSP</link>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="components"><title>Component Map</title>
      <p>
        The Apache POI distribution consists of support for many document file formats. This support is provided
        in several Jar files. Not all of the Jars are needed for every format. The following tables
        show the relationships between POI components, Maven repository tags, and the project's Jar files.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        poi-ooxml requires poi-ooxml-schemas. This is a substantially smaller 
        version of the ooxml-schemas jar (ooxml-schemas-1.1.jar for POI 3.7 or 
        later, ooxml-scheams-1.0.jar for POI 3.5 and 3.6).
        The larger ooxml-schemas jar is <link href="faq.html#faq-N10025">normally</link> 
        only required for development.
        Similar to the ooxml-schemas jar, the ooxml-security jar contains 
        all generated classes for the encryption and signing schemas
        and is subsetted in poi-ooxml-schemas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The OOXML jars require a stax implementation, but now that Apache
        POI requires Java 6, that dependency is provided by the JRE and no additional
        stax jars are required. The OOXML jars used to require DOM4J, but
        the code has now been changed to use JAXP and no additional dom4j
        jars are required. By the way, look at this <link href="faq.html#faq-N1017E">FAQ</link>
        if you have problems when using a non-Oracle JDK.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ooxml schemas jars are compiled with Apache XMLBeans 2.3, and so
        can be used at runtime with any version of XMLBeans from 2.3 or newer.
        Wherever possible though, we recommend that you use XMLBeans 2.6.0
        with Apache POI, and that is the version now shipped in the binary
        release packages.
      </p>

    <section><title>Examples</title>
      <p>
	    Small sample programs using the POI API are available in the
        <link href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/">src/examples</link> 
        directory of the source distribution.
      </p>
        <section><title>POI Browser</title>
          <p>
            The POI Browser is a very simple Swing GUI tool that displays the
            internal structure of a Microsoft Office file and especially the
            property set streams. Further information and  instructions how to
            execute it can be found in the <link
          href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/poifs/poibrowser/POIBrowser.java">POI
              source code</link>.
          </p>
        </section>
      <p>
        All of the examples are inclided in POI distributions as a poi-examples artifact.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Contributed Software</title>
      <p>
	    Besides the "official" components outlined above there is some further
	    software distributed with POI. This is called "contributed" software. It
        is not explicitly recommended or even maintained by the POI team, but
        it might still be useful to you.
      </p>
