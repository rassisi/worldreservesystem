    <section><title>Download the Source</title>
      <p>
         Most users of the source code probably don't need to have day to 
         day access to the source code as it changes. Most users will want
         to make use of our <link href="download.html">source release</link>
         packages, which contain the complete source tree for each binary
         release, suitable for browsing or debugging. These source releases
         are available from our
         <link href="download.html">download page.</link>
      </p>
      <p>
         The Apache POI sourcecode is also available as source artifacts
         in the Maven Central repository, which may be helpful for those
         users who make use of POI and wish to inspect the source (eg when
         debugging in an IDE).

    <section><title>Access the Version Controlled Source Code</title>
      <p>
         For general information on connecting to the ASF Subversion, 
         repositories, see the 
         <link href="http://www.apache.org/dev/version-control.html">version control page.</link>
      </p>
      <p>Subversion is an open-source version control system. It has been contributed to the Apache Software Foundation and is
	now available <link href="http://subversion.apache.org/">here</link>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The root url of the ASF Subversion repository is 
       <link href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/</link>,
       and the Apache POI source code lives within
       <link href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/</link>
      </p>

      <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When checking out a subproject using 
       subversion, ensure that you are checking out a tag, a branch or trunk 
       (the main-line) and not all tags and branches, to avoid filling up 
       your hard-disk and wasting bandwidth.
      </p>

      <ul>
       <li>For read only access to the latest Apache POI code, please use
        <link href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/</link></li>
       <li>To browse the svn repository in your web browser, please us
        <link href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/poi/">ViewSVN</link></li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you are not a <em>Committer</em>, but you want to submit patches

    <section><title>Git access to POI sources </title>
      <p>
        The master source repository for Apache POI is the Subversion
        one listed above. To support those users and developers who prefer
        to use the Git tooling, read-only access to the POI source tree is
        also available via Git. The Git mirrors normally track SVN to 
        within a few minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The official read-only Git repository for Apache POI is available
        from <link href="http://git.apache.org/">git.apache.org/</link> .
        The Git Clone URL is: <link href="git://git.apache.org/poi.git">git://git.apache.org/poi.git</link> 
        and Http Clone URL: <link href="http://git.apache.org/poi.git">http://git.apache.org/poi.git</link> .
        Please see the <link href="http://git.apache.org/">Git at 
        Apache</link> page for more details on the service.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the <link href="http://git.apache.org/">git.apache.org</link>
        repository, changes are also mirrored in near-realtime to GitHub.
        The GitHub repository is available at
        <link href="https://github.com/apache/poi">https://github.com/apache/poi</link> .
        Please note that the GitHub repository is read-only, but pull requests sent
        to it will result in an email being sent to the mailing list. A Git-formatted
        patch added to Bugzilla is generally preferred though, as it can be tracked
        along with all the other contributions. Please see the
        <link href="guidelines.html">contribution guidelines</link> for more 
        information on getting involved in the project.</p>

    <section><title>Code metrics </title>
      <p>
        We are trying to get code quality reports for Apache POI on the <link href="http://analysis.apache.org/">Apache Sonar instance</link>, 
        see <link href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-8567">INFRA-8567</link> 
        for some discussion
      </p>
      <p>
        Sonar provides lots of useful numbers and statistics, especially
        watching the project over time shows how some of the indicators evolve
        and allows to see which areas need some polishing.
