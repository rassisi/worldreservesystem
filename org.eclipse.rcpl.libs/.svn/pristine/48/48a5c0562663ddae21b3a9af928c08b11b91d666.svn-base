            <p>HSMF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Outlook MSG format.</p>
            <p>At this time, it provides low-level read access to all of the file, along
			    with a user-facing way to get at the common textual content of MSG files.
             to all</p>
            <p>There is an example MSG textual renderer, which shows how to access the
             common parts such as sender, subject, message body and examples. This is
             in the 
                <link href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/poi/trunk/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/hsmf/examples/">HSMF examples area</link> 
             of SVN. You may also wish to look at the unit tests for more use guides.</p>

            <note> 
                This code currently lives the 
                <link href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/">scratchpad area</link> 
                of the POI SVN repository. 
                Ensure that you have the scratchpad jar or the scratchpad 
                build area in your classpath before experimenting with this code.
